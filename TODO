Outstanding tasks

 - SkyRoads roads handler stores file length in size field (instead of decompressed
   length.)  Not sure how to fix this without embedding a decompressor.

 - Implement God of Thunder (de)compression

 - Overwriting one of the Dangerous Dave tilesets with a more compressible
   version may leave leftover data as the file's slot cannot be resized.  Make
   sure this is padded with something harmless so that a buffer overflow does
   not occur when the game performs the expansion.

 - Add tests for Secret Agent encryption/decryption

 - Add tests for Stargunner decompression, and confirm files go in as uncompressed

 - Allow files within folders to be extracted/replaced by order using dots in
   the @ notation
