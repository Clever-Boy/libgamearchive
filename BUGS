Known bugs
----------

 - Because Monster Bash .DAT files store a type ID instead of a file extension,
   but they also support file extensions, the filename length limit always
   includes the extension even it if is a fake one (fake extensions are used to
   differentiate between files with the same name but different type IDs.)
   This means using a really long filename with one of the fake extensions may
   return a filename-too-long error when the filename would actually fit due to
   the fake extension being removed.  However the likelihood of this seems
   remote, so it is unlikely to be fixed.

 - Extracting and reinserting vgadave.dav into dave.exe results in very obvious
   graphical corruption.  This is because the Camoto compressor is slightly more
   efficient than the original one, so the recompressed file is a few bytes
   smaller.  Because the file size cannot be set (or it is not known how), this
   means there are some trailing bytes at the end of the data which the game
   tries to decompress, which causes it to overwrite parts of memory.
