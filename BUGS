Known bugs
----------

 - Because Monster Bash .DAT files store a type ID instead of a file extension,
   but they also support file extensions, the filename length limit always
   includes the extension even it if is a fake one (fake extensions are used to
   differentiate between files with the same name but different type IDs.)
   This means using a really long filename with one of the fake extensions may
   return a filename-too-long error when the filename would actually fit due to
   the fake extension being removed.  However the likelihood of this seems
   remote, so it is unlikely to be fixed.
