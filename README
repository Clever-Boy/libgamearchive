Camoto: Classic-game Modding Tools

Camoto is a collection of utilities for editing (modding) "classic games",
those from the early to mid 1990s.

This is libgamearchive, one component of the Camoto suite.  libgamearchive
is a library that provides access to different "archive" files used by games
to store all their data files.  Just like a .zip file, many games squash all
their data files together into one big data file, and this library provides
access to those data files.  It currently supports full editing, so files can
be extracted, added, removed and replaced from supported archive formats.

This library is still in the preliminary stages, so only the following formats
have been implemented:

  * Cosmo's Cosmic Adventures (.vol, .stn)
  * Duke Nukem II (.cmp)
  * Duke Nukem 3D (.grp)
  * Major Stryker (.ms[123])

Many more formats are planned.

All supported archive formats are fully documented on the ModdingWiki - see
http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/

This library is released under the GPLv3 license.
